# Marvin

A Web-based Information System that aggregates useful tools for managing teaching and research tasks in an university.

Many students from the [Department of Computer Science](http://informatica.ufes.br) of the [Federal University of Esp√≠rito Santo](http://www.internacional.ufes.br/en) develop tools as part of their undergraduate final project. Marvin is an attempt to integrate these tools in a way they can be actually used by people.


## Coming soon

A new version of Marvin is being built from scratch based on [the old version](https://github.com/dwws-ufes/Marvin.old). Once a significant amount of code is migrated, instructions on how to deploy and run using [Docker](https://www.docker.com) will be provided.
