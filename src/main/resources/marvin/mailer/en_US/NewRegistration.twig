Welcome to Marvin @ {{ config.institutionAcronym }}
Hi...

I'm Marvin, the Paranoid Android, working for {{ config.institutionAcronym }} at {{ config.baseURL }}.

Someone has registered themselves as a new academic using this e-mail address, which means you can use me now. I won't enjoy it.

If this was you, you can set yourself a password here: {{ config.baseURL }}/servlet/changePassword/{{ academic.passwordCode }}

If this wasn't you, this means I'm right and the universe is a terrible place. Just ignore this e-mail. I'm used to being ignored anyways.

I didn't ask to be made.
